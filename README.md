# Connectivity Monitor Library

A lightweight Android library that monitors network connectivity and exposes the device's network state as Kotlin `StateFlow`.

## Features

- ðŸ”„ Real-time network connectivity monitoring
- ðŸŒŠ Reactive `StateFlow` API
- ðŸŽ¯ Distinguishes between connected, disconnected, and limited connectivity states
- ðŸ“± Modern Kotlin Coroutines support
- ðŸ§ª Well-tested and reliable
- ðŸ“¦ Lightweight with minimal dependencies

## Installation

### Add to your module's `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.sami00777:connectivity-monitoring:1.0.2")
}
```

### Required Permissions

The library automatically includes the required permission in its manifest:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    private lateinit var connectivityMonitor: ConnectivityMonitor
    
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        
        // Initialize the connectivity monitor
        connectivityMonitor = ConnectivityMonitor(this)
        
        // Collect connection state
        lifecycleScope.launch {
            connectivityMonitor.connectionState.collect { state ->
                when (state) {
                    is ConnectionState.Connected -> {
                        // Device is online with validated internet access
                        showOnlineUI()
                    }
                    is ConnectionState.Disconnected -> {
                        // Device is not connected to any network
                        showOfflineUI()
                    }
                    is ConnectionState.ConnectedWithoutInternet -> {
                        // Device is connected to network but no internet access
                        showLimitedConnectivityUI()
                    }
                    is ConnectionState.Unknown -> {
                        // Connection state is being determined
                        showLoadingUI()
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Simple Online/Offline Monitoring

```kotlin
// Just check if online or offline
lifecycleScope.launch {
    connectivityMonitor.isOnline.collect { isOnline ->
        if (isOnline) {
            // Device has internet access
            enableOnlineFeatures()
        } else {
            // Device is offline or has limited connectivity
            enableOfflineMode()
        }
    }
}
```

### ViewModel Integration

```kotlin
class MainViewModel(application: Application) : AndroidViewModel(application) {
    private val connectivityMonitor = ConnectivityMonitor(application)
    
    val connectionState = connectivityMonitor.connectionState
    val isOnline = connectivityMonitor.isOnline
    
    fun performNetworkOperation() {
        if (connectivityMonitor.isCurrentlyOnline()) {
            // Perform network operation
        } else {
            // Handle offline state
        }
    }
}
```

### Repository Pattern

```kotlin
class DataRepository(private val connectivityMonitor: ConnectivityMonitor) {
    
    suspend fun getData(): Result<Data> {
        return when (connectivityMonitor.connectionState.value) {
            is ConnectionState.Connected -> {
                // Fetch from network
                fetchFromNetwork()
            }
            else -> {
                // Fetch from cache or return error
                fetchFromCache()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## API Reference

### ConnectivityMonitor

Main class for monitoring network connectivity.

**Constructor:**
- `ConnectivityMonitor(context: Context)`

**Properties:**
- `connectionState: StateFlow<ConnectionState>` - Emits current connection state
- `isOnline: StateFlow<Boolean>` - Emits true when device has validated internet access

**Methods:**
- `getCurrentConnectionState(): ConnectionState` - Get current state synchronously
- `isCurrentlyOnline(): Boolean` - Get current online status synchronously

### ConnectionState

Sealed class representing network connectivity states:

- `ConnectionState.Connected` - Device has validated internet access
- `ConnectionState.Disconnected` - Device is not connected to any network
- `ConnectionState.ConnectedWithoutInternet` - Device is connected but no internet access
- `ConnectionState.Unknown` - Connection state is being determined

**Extensions:**
- `ConnectionState.isOnline: Boolean` - True only for `Connected` state

## Requirements

- Android API 24+ (Android 7.0)
- Kotlin 1.8+
- Coroutines support
